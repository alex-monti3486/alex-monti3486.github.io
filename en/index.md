# Welcome to my website!

My name is Alexandre Monti and I am a mathematical engineer currently completing a MAS in secondary education at HEP Lausanne.

With a background in applied mathematics and a strong interest in real-world problem solving, I am interested both in teaching and in applying mathematics professionally — for example in sectors like transportation, energy, or applied research.

I am currently looking for a position starting in July 2026, either as a teacher or an engineer, in a stimulating environment where rigor, curiosity, and creativity are valued.

On this site, you will find my CV, several personal and academic projects, and information about my professional journey.
