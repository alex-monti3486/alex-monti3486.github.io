### [High School Graduation Math Exam Topics – Standard Level: With Detailed Solutions](https://www.amazon.fr/Sujets-dexamen-maturité-gymnasiale-standard/dp/B093RV4VQZ)
<p align="justify"> This book is a collection of exercises taken from standard-level high school graduation mathematics exams. It contains thirty exercises and covers topics such as functions, geometry, and probability. It comes with detailed solutions that explain each calculation so that students can easily follow the underlying reasoning and, most importantly, internalize the solutions to become more independent during their revision. </p>

### [[Projet de Master] Application of the information-theoretic clustering to the discrete choice](/projects/final-report-PDM.pdf)

<p align="justify"> Master’s project exploring the application of the Deterministic Information Bottleneck (DIB) algorithm to discrete choice models in order to improve their selection and evaluation. By combining information theory with choice analysis, DIB helps identify the most relevant models, providing better predictive performance and a more reliable interpretation of individual behavior. </p>

### [[Projet de Bachelor] American Causal Inference Conference Data Challenge 2022](/projects/final-report-BA.pdf)

<p align="justify"> Bachelor project conducted as part of the ACIC Data Challenge 2022, aiming to estimate the impact of a medical intervention on healthcare expenditures. The analysis combines data exploration, causal graphs, and temporal adjustment to identify the true effects of the treatment. </p>

### [[Projet de semestre] Robust mean estimation on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices](/projects/final-report-MA2.pdf)

<p align="justify"> This semester project focuses on robust mean estimation for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. Unlike classical estimators, which are sensitive to outliers and deviations from normality, robust methods provide more reliable results in complex real-world contexts. The aim is to explore different techniques, focus on the most computationally efficient one, and demonstrate their usefulness for improving statistical analysis of structured data. </p>

### [Marriage number evolution in Switzerland (1999-2021)](/projects/small_project_static.html)

<p align="justify"> This project, carried out in collaboration with Alessio Assuelli and Wael Gafaiti, analyzes the evolution of the number of marriages in Switzerland between 1999 and 2021. We studied changes in the number of marriages per 1,000 inhabitants (NMTP), as well as the age, sex, religion, and wealth of the cantons. The results show a general decline in NMTP since 2010, with urban and wealthy cantons being more active in marriage, and differences depending on the age and sex of the spouses. Interactive visualizations and maps illustrate these trends at the cantonal and regional levels. </p>

### [Local regression in R](/projects/local-regression-in-R.html)

<p align="justify"> This project, completed in collaboration with Alessio Assuelli and Wael Gafaiti, compares three R packages (lpridge, locfit, locpol) used for local regression. The study shows that lpridge is the fastest and most accurate, locfit is fast but less stable, and locpol is accurate but slower. The choice of bandwidth is crucial for model performance. </p>
